### Installation
> Protip - you have to run your own instance of [Barenote Api](https://github.com/marszczybrew/barenote-api) and (if needed) adjust the remote URL in `app.php`  

Before running this app you have to install its dependencies - this can be done automatically with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) by running `composer install`

### Usage
Once you have your API instance up and running you can have a look at `app.php` and make sure that the _url_ is correct. If so, go on and run the file - application is interactive. You will first be asked to provide your credentials and then given access to more features such as viewing a list of notes or details of one of them.

### About the project
This is part of a suite of apps which I've written for _Internet Programming_ course on my BSc Computer Science studies.
